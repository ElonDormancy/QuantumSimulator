# Introduction

The Page is able to drag and drop to plot the quantum circuit and calculate the state evolution with the gate operator.

The circuit you drag to plot will display below the area where you drag.

The final state after applying the operators will display below the area where the plot shows.

If you want to calculate the more qubits like more than 30,Recommand you to click [here][https://github.com/ElonDormancy/QuantumSimulator] to get the parallel version[C++].

Welcome to Fork and Star !

## Manual

1.Input the **rows** and **cols** where decide the size of your circuit

2.Drag and Drop the gate or control gate into the canvnas[Gate continuously loading and wait]

## Attention

1.You can't replace a single part of the control gate.

2.Because of the limitation of the Javascript single thread the program provide the operator evolution below the number of qubit less than 6.
